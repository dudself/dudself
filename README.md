🧙 Hi, I’m Didenur — or you might know me online as Vin!
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Süleyman Demirel University. My interests span web development, accessibility, mobile development, graphic design, and UI/UX. <br>
⌛ Alongside a decade of experience in graphic design, I’ve been working professionally in web development for over 4+ years and mobile app development for more than 3+ years. The technologies I use most frequently include React, React Native, Next.js, and TypeScript. My focus is on building secure, accessible, and high-performance applications. <br>
🐸  I’m highly dedicated to the fields I care about, which drives me to stay up-to-date, research continuously, and keep learning.<br>
🍄 Beyond software, two areas play a significant role in my life:
<br>
As a disabled, autistic, and neurodivergent self-advocate, I’ve been leading  [Merhaba! Spektrum](https://merhabaspektrum.com) for nearly 5 years and co-founded the [Özgür Eller Otizm İnisiyatifi](https://ozgureller.org)about 3 years ago.
<br>
My long-standing passion for graphic design has given me a strong aesthetic perspective that I apply both in professional projects and personal work.
